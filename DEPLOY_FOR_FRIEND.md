2. **Access credentials** (if needed for backend/Expo account)
3. **This deployment guide**

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites You Need

### 1. **Apple Developer Account** (REQUIRED)
- Must be an **active paid account** ($99/year)
- Must have **Admin** or **App Manager** role
- Bundle ID `com.growzone.growzonesocial` must be registered

- EAS CLI (will install in steps below)

---

## üéØ Deployment Options

You have 3 options:

### **Option A: Cloud Build with EAS (Easiest - No Mac Required)**
‚úÖ Recommended if you don't have a Mac
‚úÖ EAS handles everything in the cloud
‚úÖ Takes 15-30 minutes

### **Option B: Local Build (Requires Mac)**
‚úÖ If you have a Mac with Xcode
‚úÖ More control over the process
‚úÖ Faster for iterations

### **Option C: Transfer to Your Apple Account**
‚úÖ Use your own Apple Developer account
‚úÖ Change Bundle ID to your own
‚úÖ Full control

---

## üöÄ OPTION A: Cloud Build with EAS (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd growzone-mobile

# Install Node modules
npm install

# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Expo

```bash
# Login with Expo credentials
eas login

# Enter credentials for: growzone.inc
# (Get credentials from the main developer)
```

### Step 3: Configure Apple Credentials

```bash
# Configure Apple Developer credentials
eas build:configure
```

When prompted:
- Select **iOS**
- Choose **"Let EAS handle credentials"** (easiest)
- Enter your **Apple ID** (with valid Developer account)
- Enter your **App-Specific Password**

**How to generate App-Specific Password:**
1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Go to **Security** section
4. Click **Generate Password** under App-Specific Passwords
5. Label it "EAS CLI" and copy the password

### Step 4: Build for TestFlight

```bash
# Build and auto-submit to TestFlight
eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit
```

**What happens next:**
1. ‚úÖ EAS uploads the code to their servers
2. ‚úÖ Builds the iOS app in the cloud (15-30 min)
3. ‚úÖ Signs it with your Apple certificates
4. ‚úÖ Automatically submits to TestFlight
5. ‚úÖ You get an email when it's done

### Step 5: Monitor Build Progress

```bash
# Check build status
eas build:list --platform ios

# View build details
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]
```

Or visit: https://expo.dev/accounts/growzone.inc/projects/growzone/builds

### Step 6: TestFlight Configuration

After the build is uploaded:

1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Navigate to **My Apps** > **Growzone**
3. Go to **TestFlight** tab
4. Wait for processing (5-15 minutes)
5. Add **Internal Testers**:
   - TestFlight > Internal Testing
   - Click "+" to add testers
   - Enter email addresses
6. Or add **External Testers** (requires Apple review):
   - TestFlight > External Testing
   - Create a new group
   - Add testers and submit for review

### Step 7: Share TestFlight Link

Once approved, you'll get a public link:
```
https://testflight.apple.com/join/[UNIQUE-CODE]
```

Share this link with testers!

3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. **Automatically manage signing** (check this)
5. Select your **Team** (Apple Developer account)
6. Bundle Identifier should be: `com.growzone.growzonesocial`

### Step 5: Archive the App

1. In Xcode menu: **Product** > **Destination** > **Any iOS Device**
2. **Product** > **Archive**
3. Wait for the archive to complete (5-10 minutes)
4. **Window** > **Organizer** opens automatically

  }
}
```

# NOT your regular Apple ID password
```

### Build takes too long
```bash
# Check build status
eas build:list

# View logs
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]
```

### TestFlight not showing build
- Wait 10-15 minutes after upload
- Check App Store Connect > Activity
- Build might be in "Processing" status
- Check for any compliance questions that need answering
